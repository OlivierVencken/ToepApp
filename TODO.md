Implement settings tab 
- sounds on/off 
- max points 
- max small player points

Implement warnings
- "armoede" warning --> one point before max points
- small player warning --> when on max small player points

What should the leaderboard count?
- wins?
- win/lose ?
- points --> first gets points, while 2, 3 and 4 lose, where the lower you ended the more points you lose?
